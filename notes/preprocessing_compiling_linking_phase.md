## Overview
When transforming C code into an executable, the major steps typically involve the following:

1. **Preprocessing**: In this phase, the preprocessor processes directives like #include, #define, and #ifdef. It replaces macros, includes header files, and performs other text manipulations to prepare the code for compilation.

2. **Compilation**: The preprocessed code is compiled by the compiler, which translates the C source code into assembly language or directly into machine code. This phase involves lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The output of this phase is usually one or more object files containing machine code specific to the target architecture.

3. **Linking**: If there are multiple source files or external libraries, the linker combines the object files together to create an executable or a shared library. The linker resolves symbol references, performs symbol relocation, and creates the final executable file. This phase also involves performing library linking and handling external dependencies.

4. **Loading**: In systems where dynamic linking is used, the operating system loader loads the executable and its required libraries into memory. This step prepares the program for execution by allocating memory, resolving dynamic symbol references, and setting up the execution environment.

5. **Execution**: The operating system transfers control to the entry point of the executable. The program starts executing from the main function or the designated entry point specified during compilation. The instructions in the executable are executed, and the program performs its intended tasks.
